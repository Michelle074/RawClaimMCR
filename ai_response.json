                1. A header section with these fields:
                Customer Name
                Contract Number
                Period (start date and end date)
                Annualised to (number of months)
                IBNR
                Data as of

                2. A table listing each benefit line, with columns:
                Benefit
                Actual Subscription
                Actual Claims with IBNR
                Actual Loss Ratio

                Your task:
                1. Extract header values and assign to variables:
                client_name ← Customer Name
                policy_number ← Contract Number
                policy_start_date ← the Period start date
                policy_end_date ← one year after the Period start date
                duration ← Annualised to
                ibnr ← IBNR
                data_as_of ← Data as of

                2. For each row in the benefit table:
                benefit_type ← Benefit
                actual_premium ← Actual Subscription (numeric)
                actual_paid_w_ibnr ← Actual Claims with IBNR (numeric)
                loss_ratio ← Actual Loss Ratio (string with percent)

                3. Build
                policy_id by concatenating policy_number, an underscore, and the year+month of policy_start_date (formatted YYYYMM).

                4. Assemble all rows into an Excel sheet with these columns (in order):`

                policy_id,
                policy_number,
                insurer,        ← leave blank
                client_name,
                policy_start_date,   ← YYYY-MM-DD
                policy_end_date,     ← YYYY-MM-DD
                duration,            ← integer months
                ibnr,                ← percent string
                data_as_of,          ← YYYY-MM-DD
                benefit_type,
                actual_premium,      ← numeric
                actual_paid_w_ibnr,  ← numeric
                loss_ratio           ← percent string
                
                5. Write the result to a .xlsx file.
                Produce only the final Excel file (or code to generate it)—do not include any example values."""},
